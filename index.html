    <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
    <p>My name is Widmaer Fleuransaint and I am pursing a master degree from Boston University Metropolitan college.
      When I am not studying, I am either taking pictures, playing my guitar or drawing. I currently live and work in
      Massachusetts as a customer service representative while I obtain my degree. This site will explore the
      main parts of my life, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/widmaer09/">photography</a>, music and drawing.
      I have always loved music, since I was young,
      I participated in any musical assemble that would have me.
      All throughout  high school I was either second chair or first chair in my local jazz band and orchestra.
      I use to play the trombone but have since picked up the guitar. I am not that good but when I practice
      I play like I am auditioning for the Boston philharmonic, or at least I try too. In any case, this blog entry is just a short introduction into what
      I love to do when I am not working or programming.
    </p>

    <h1>Why do I have so many hobbies?</h1>
    <p>My interest in the hobbies I have is like a wave, sometimes Its intense and I can spend the whole afternoon lost in what ever hobby I am currently working on or I bounce from one little project to another till   I am bored.
      I get bored very easily so if my hobbies are currently not interesting to me I usually travel.I have travelled every year for the past 3 years. Below are some of the pictures I took on my trips.
